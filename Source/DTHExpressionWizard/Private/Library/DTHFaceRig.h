/**
 * How a character's DTH face setup (its post-process blueprint and face rig) turns face-board curves into weights of
 * DTH's face poses, as measured on the user's own project by FDTHFaceRigProbe. Nothing about DTH's rig ships with the
 * plugin; this is written to the project's Saved folder and measured again when DTH's content changes.
 *
 * Model: weight(pose) = sum of Weight * f(curve) over Linear + sum of Weight * f(a) * f(b) over Pairs, where f(x) is
 * x raised to the curve's Exponent (1, or 2 for curves whose effect goes with the square).
